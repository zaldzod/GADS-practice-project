LAB TITLE: GOOGLE CLOUD FUNDAMENTALS: GETTING STARTED WITH COMPUTE ENGINE

TASK 1: sign in to the Google Cloud Platform Console

/***For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a 
fixed time at no cost. 
Make sure you sign into Qwiklabs using an incognito window 
Note the lab's access time
When ready, click 'START LAB'
Note your lab credentials. You use them to sign in to Cloud Platform Console
Click open Google Console
Click Use another account and copy.paste credentials for lab into prompts
Accept the terms and skip the recoovery resource page***/

TASK 2: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console

1. To create an instance with name - my-vm-1 in region us-central1-c, standard machine-type and a Debian GNU Linux Stretch boot disk:

2. get current version of Debian GNU Linux Stretch boot disk

	gcloud compute images list | grep debian 

3. create vm instance

	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type n1-standard-1 --image-project debian-cloud  --image debian-9-stretch-v20200910 --subnet default --tags allow-http

4. To allow http, create a firewall rule allowing ingress on HTTP traffic

	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http-traffic --allow tcp:80 --target-tags allow-http --network=default --direction=INGRESS --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
	


TASK 3: Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line

1.	In GCP Console, on the top right toolbar, click the open Cloud Shell button. When prompted, click Continue

2.  To display a list of zones in the Qwiklabs assigned region, type:
       gcloud compute zones list | grep [asigned region]

3. 	Choose a zone from the list. To set chosen zone as default, type:
		gcloud config set compute/zone [chosen zone]
		
4.	The zone has now been set/ fixed to your chosen zone. Any 
	compute resource created will accept that zone as default, unless it is overwritten using the --zone tag

5.	Create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in the default zone.

		gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type n1-standard-1 --image-project debian-cloud  --image debian-9-stretch-v20200910 --subnet default 

6.	Vm takes about 2 minutes to spin up. To exit cloudshell:

		exit



TASK 4: Connect between VM instances

1. To open a command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, type:
        gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
        
2. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1

        ping -c 3 my-vm-1
    
3. Open a second Cloud shell tab, by clicking the + button

4. Use the SSH command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1

        gcloud compute ssh my-vm-1 --zone=us-central1-a
        
5. At the command prompt, install the web server:

        sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
 
6. Use the nano text edito to add a custom message to home page of server:
        
        sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
   
7. Scroll using the arrow keys, to the line just below the h1 header. Replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
        
        Hi from YOUR_NAME
 
8.  Press Ctrl+O and Enter to save your edit, then press Ctrl+X to exit. To confirm that the web server is serving a new page, type:

        curl http://localhost/
        
9. The response should be the HTML page of the web server. To exit, type:
        
        exit
        
10. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, execute:

        curl http://my-vm-1/

11. To find the external IP address of my-vm-1, execute the command:

        gcloud compute instances list

12. Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
