Task 1: Explore the networks and instances

To verify that vpn-network-1 and vpn-network-2 have been created with subnets in separate regions:

	gcloud compute networks list

To view the subnets:

	gcloud compute networks subnets list 
	
Explore the firewall rules: The network-1-allow-ssh and network-1-allow-icmp firewall rules have been created for vpn-network-1. 

The network-2-allow-ssh and network-2-allow-icmp have also been created for vpn-network-2. To verify both, execute:

	gcloud compute firewall-rules 
	
Explore connectivity: To obtain the internal and external IP addresses of the VM instances. type:

	gcloud compute instances list
	
Note the extenal and internal IP address of the server-2 instance. 

To SSH into server-1 VM instance, type:
	
	gcloud compute ssh server-1 --zone=us-central1-b
	
To test connectivity to server-2's extenal IP address, run the command:
	
	ping -c 3 <Enter server-2's external IP address here>

To test connectivity to server-2's internal IP address, run the command:
		
	ping -c 3 <Enter server-2's internal IP address here>
	
	A 100% packet loss is expected, because there is no VPN connectivity yet

Exit the SSH terminal. Run the command:
	
	exit
	
Note the external and internal IP addresses for server-1. For server-2, SSH:

	gcloud compute ssh server-2 --zone=europe-west1-b
	
To test connectivity to server-1's external IP address, run the command:

	ping -c 3 <Enter server-1's external IP address here>
	
To test connectivity to server-1's internal IP address, run the command:

	ping -c 3 <Enter server-1's internal IP address here>

Exit the SSH terminal




Task 2: Create the VPN gateways and tunnels

Reserve two static IP addresses. One for each VPN gateway.

	gcloud compute addresses create vpn-1-static-ip --region us-central1 
	
	gcloud compute addresses create vpn-2-static-ip --region europe-west1
	
To create VPN connection. First we set up a VPN connection called VPN 1.

	gcloud compute target-vpn-gateways create vpn-1 --region us-central1 --network vpn-network-1

	gcloud compute forwarding-rules create vpn-1-rule-esp --region us-central1 --address 35.223.131.59 --ip-protocol ESP --target-vpn-gateway vpn-1

	gcloud compute  forwarding-rules create vpn-1-rule-udp500 --region us-central1 --address 35.223.131.59 --ip-protocol UDP --ports 500 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-1

	gcloud compute forwarding-rules create vpn-1-rule-udp4500 --region us-central1 --address 35.223.131.59 --ip-protocol UDP --ports 4500 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-1

	gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create tunnel1to2 --region us-central1 --peer-address 146.148.119.99 --shared-secret gcprocks --ike-version 2 --local-traffic-selector 0.0.0.0/0 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-1

	gcloud compute routes create tunnel1to2-route-1 --network vpn-network-1 --next-hop-vpn-tunnel tunnel1to2 --next-hop-vpn-tunnel-region us-central1 --destination-range 10.1.3.0/24


Then set up a VPN connection for vpn-network-2, called VPN-2:
	
	gcloud compute target-vpn-gateways create vpn-2 --region europe-west1 --network vpn-network-2

	gcloud compute forwarding-rules create vpn-2-rule-esp --region europe-west1 --address 146.148.119.99 --ip-protocol ESP --target-vpn-gateway vpn-2

	gcloud compute forwarding-rules create vpn-2-rule-udp500 --region europe-west1 --address 146.148.119.99 --ip-protocol UDP --ports 500 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-2

	gcloud compute forwarding-rules create vpn-2-rule-udp4500 --region europe-west1 --address 146.148.119.99 --ip-protocol UDP --ports 4500 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-2

	gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create tunnel2to1 --region europe-west1 --peer-address 35.223.131.59 --shared-secret gcprocks --ike-version 2 --local-traffic-selector 0.0.0.0/0 --target-vpn-gateway vpn-2

	gcloud compute routes create tunnel2to1-route-1 --network vpn-network-2 --next-hop-vpn-tunnel tunnel2to1 --next-hop-vpn-tunnel-region europe-west1 --destination-range 10.5.4.0/24 

	
Task 3: Verify VPN connectivity

To test connectivity from server-1 to server-2. SSH into server-1:

	gcloud compute ssh server-1 --zone=us-central1-b

Ping server-2's IP address by running the following command:

	ping -c 3 <Enter server-2's external IP address here>
	
Exit the terminal:

	exit

To test connectivity from server-2 to server-1. SSH into server-2:
	
	gcloud compute ssh server-2 --zone=europe-west1-b

Ping server-1's IP address by running the following command:

	ping -c 3 <Enter server-1's external IP address here>

Exit the terminal:

	exit
	
Remove the external IP addresses.

In order to modify the network interface of server-1, the instance has to be stopped. To stop the instance, run the following command:

	gcloud compute instances stop server-1
	
To release the external IP address of server-1 so that it is returned to the general IP pool for other Compute Engine users:

	gcloud compute addresses delete vpn-1-static-ip
	
Restart server-1 VM instance:

	gcloud compute instances start server-1

To test connectivity from server-2 to server-1. SSH into server-2:

	gcloud compute ssh server-2 --zone=europe-west1-b
	
Ping server-1's IP address by running the following command:

	ping -c 3 <Enter server-1's external IP address here>
	
The ping should work.
